# React Strava Weekly Graphs

This React app shows [my Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/3350904) activity data in a stacked bar chart format, by week, by activity & type/hours performed.

A custom Node backend connects to the Strava API and provides filtered access to my Strava data. An AWS Lambda function syncs the API and database every hour. We can then visualize the data on the frontend with React. So it's [React on the frontend and Node/ES6/Mongoose on the backend](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-create-react-app-work-with-a-node-backend-api-7c5c48acb1b0). :smiley:

I mostly use this app for visualizing my own training data, but please feel free to fork this project and use it for your own purposes.
